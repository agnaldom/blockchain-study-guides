# Introducing Blockchain Applications Through Distributed Systems

The Blockchain tecnology employs several aspects of distributed networks and the distributed system is also connected to the majority of blockchain-based applications.
As a result, you need a thorough understanding of emerging technologies in the distributed systems.

When you think of distributed systems, you must keep in mind that they are systems for wich processing is distributed. This does not necessarily have to be physically distributed, but he processing components must be distributed and not united in a single block. 
This maens that hardware and software architectures maintain the distributed system.
Everytgin must be interconnected: the CPU through the network and the processes through the communication system. Distributed systems have inifinte use cases, including electronic banking systems, massively multiplayer online games, and sensor networks.

# 1.1 Blockchain Use Cases

Since many blockchain applications are used in a distributed system environment, it is good to know about these technologies in depth.

* **Blockchain in the insurance sector:** In the insurance industry, blockchain enables safe and decentralized transactions, establishing a solid foundation for preventing fraud, providin more control, and improvind data and reporting. Furthermore, insurance companies can have up-to-date, accurate notifications about changes, thanks to blockchain, which allows them to improve risk management and maximize capital and fund opportunities. It also allows for the possibility of implementing Big Data strategies, which are very useful for obtaining secure information about customers, priorities, and preferences.
* **Blockchain in digital payments:** Blockchain also has a lot of potential applications in digital payments. Obviously, there are still many issues to be resolved, such as transaction processing time, which is still extremely sluggish when compared to the demands of the market and a fast-paced wolrd. The system's performance should be enhanced so it can be better absorbed by digital payments. Clear regulatory guideline and a more thorough study of risks are two of blockchain's problems in the digital payments industry. Despite these difficulties, there is potential for this new tecnology to be used in figital payments.
* **Blockchain in agrifood:** The benefits of using blockchain in the agrifood industry are numerous. There are several uses of blockchain in the agrifood business, ranging from decentralization to shared control to immutability and information conservation. Blockchain's advantages apper to be particularly essential to the processing sector, as well as all operations and innovations linked to food certification. The blockchain allows users to establish open supply chains that include all of the playes: raw material producers, logistics and transportation businesses, companies that work with raw materials at various stages of transformation, and companies that work with packaging and marketing. Finally, retial may pass along data and information to all other players while maintaining complete openness.
* **Blockchain in the energy industry:** Several projects aim to provide platforms open to all energy system stakeholders. For example, Power Ledger is an Australian startup involved in a variety of blockchain applications for renewable energy systems. The energy system operations and its markets and customers can all benefit from blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Blockchains provide disintermediation, transparency, and tamper-proof tranactions, but they also provide unique ways for consumers and small renewable providers to participate more actively in the energy market and monetize their assets.
