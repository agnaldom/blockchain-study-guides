# Introducing Blockchain Applications Through Distributed Systems

The Blockchain tecnology employs several aspects of distributed networks and the distributed system is also connected to the majority of blockchain-based applications.
As a result, you need a thorough understanding of emerging technologies in the distributed systems.

When you think of distributed systems, you must keep in mind that they are systems for wich processing is distributed. This does not necessarily have to be physically distributed, but he processing components must be distributed and not united in a single block. 
This maens that hardware and software architectures maintain the distributed system.
Everytgin must be interconnected: the CPU through the network and the processes through the communication system. Distributed systems have inifinte use cases, including electronic banking systems, massively multiplayer online games, and sensor networks.

# 1.1 Blockchain Use Cases

Since many blockchain applications are used in a distributed system environment, it is good to know about these technologies in depth.

* **Blockchain in the insurance sector:** In the insurance industry, blockchain enables safe and decentralized transactions, establishing a solid foundation for preventing fraud, providin more control, and improvind data and reporting. Furthermore, insurance companies can have up-to-date, accurate notifications about changes, thanks to blockchain, which allows them to improve risk management and maximize capital and fund opportunities. It also allows for the possibility of implementing Big Data strategies, which are very useful for obtaining secure information about customers, priorities, and preferences.
